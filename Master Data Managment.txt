SQL DATA REPORTING:
	SQL (Structured Query Language) is commonly used for data reporting tasks due to its flexibility, power, and ability to manipulate and retrieve data from databases. Here are some common SQL data reporting techniques:
		SELECT Queries: Use SELECT queries to retrieve data from one or more database tables based on specified criteria. SELECT queries can be customized to filter, sort, aggregate, and group data as needed to meet reporting requirements.

			Example:

			sql
			Copy code
			SELECT column1, column2
			FROM table_name
			WHERE condition;
			Aggregate Functions: Utilize aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX to perform calculations and summarizations on data values. Aggregate functions are useful for generating summary statistics and metrics for reporting purposes.

			Example:

			scss
			Copy code
			SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records,
				   SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales,
				   AVG(sales_amount) AS avg_sales
			FROM sales_table;
			JOIN Operations: Use JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables based on related columns. JOINs allow you to create comprehensive reports that incorporate data from different sources or related entities.

			Example:

			vbnet
			Copy code
			SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name, orders.order_date
			FROM orders
			JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
			Subqueries: Use subqueries to nest one SELECT query within another SELECT query. Subqueries can be used to retrieve data dynamically based on the results of another query, enabling more complex data reporting scenarios.

			Example:

			sql
			Copy code
			SELECT product_name, unit_price
			FROM products
			WHERE unit_price > (SELECT AVG(unit_price) FROM products);
			Window Functions: Window functions provide advanced analytical capabilities for performing calculations over a set of rows within a defined window. Window functions are useful for generating rankings, percentiles, and moving averages in data reports.

			Example:

			sql
			Copy code
			SELECT product_name, unit_price, 
				   ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY unit_price DESC) AS rank
			FROM products;
			CTE (Common Table Expressions): Use CTEs to create temporary result sets that can be referenced within subsequent SQL statements. CTEs are helpful for breaking down complex queries into more manageable and readable parts.

			Example:

			vbnet
			Copy code
			WITH top_products AS (
			  SELECT product_name, unit_price
			  FROM products
			  WHERE unit_price > 100
			)
			SELECT * FROM top_products;
			Stored Procedures: Create stored procedures to encapsulate SQL logic and perform repetitive reporting tasks. Stored procedures enhance reusability, modularity, and security of SQL code for generating reports.

			Example:

			sql
			Copy code
			CREATE PROCEDURE GetSalesReport
			AS
			BEGIN
			  SELECT order_date, SUM(order_amount) AS total_sales
			  FROM orders
			  GROUP BY order_date;
			END;

NAMING CONVENTIONS:
	Naming conventions are guidelines or standards for naming database objects such as tables, columns, indexes, stored procedures, and other database elements. 
	Consistent naming conventions help improve clarity, maintainability, and understandability of database schemas and queries. Here are some common naming conventions used in SQL databases:

		Example: customer_id, product_id, order_id.

		Foreign Key Columns:
		Name foreign key columns by prefixing the referenced table name followed by _id.
		Example: customer_id, product_id, order_id.
		
		Index Names:
		Use descriptive names to indicate the purpose of the index.
		Include the table name and column names in the index name.
		Use prefixes to indicate the type of index (e.g., idx, pk, fk).
		Example: idx_customer_name, pk_order_id, fk_customer_id.
		
		Stored Procedures:
		Use descriptive verbs followed by nouns to name stored procedures.
		Prefix stored procedures with usp_ (user-defined stored procedure).
		Use underscores (_) or camelCase for multi-word stored procedure names.
		Example: usp_GetCustomerById, usp_UpdateProductPrice.
		
		Views:
		Use descriptive names to indicate the purpose of the view.
		Prefix views with vw_ to distinguish them from tables.
		Use underscores (_) or camelCase for multi-word view names.
		Example: vw_ProductSalesSummary, vw_CustomerOrders.
		
		Constraints:
		Use descriptive names to indicate the purpose of constraints.
		Include the column name and the type of constraint in the name.
		Example: fk_customer_id, pk_order_id, chk_product_price.
		
		Triggers:
		Use descriptive names to indicate the purpose of triggers.
		Include the table name and the trigger event in the name.
		Example: trg_audit_orders_insert, trg_update_product_inventory.

		Create To-Do Lists: Start by creating to-do lists to capture and organize tasks and activities. Use tools such as notebooks, task management apps, or digital calendars to maintain and update your to-do lists regularly.
		Set Clear Goals: Define clear, specific, and achievable goals for your tasks and projects. Break down larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks to make them more actionable and attainable.
		Prioritize Tasks: Prioritize tasks based on their urgency, importance, and impact on your goals and objectives. Use prioritization techniques such as the Eisenhower Matrix, ABC prioritization, or the 80/20 rule (Pareto Principle) to identify and focus on high-priority tasks.		Use Time Management Techniques: Utilize time management techniques such as time blocking, Pomodoro Technique, or the 2-Minute Rule to allocate time effectively and minimize distractions. Set specific time slots for focused work and breaks to maintain productivity and concentration.
		Delegate Responsibilities: Delegate tasks and responsibilities to others when appropriate to leverage resources and expertise. Identify tasks that can be outsourced or assigned to team members to free up time for higher-priority activities.
		Organize Your Workspace: Keep your physical and digital workspaces clean, clutter-free, and organized. Use filing systems, folders, and labels to categorize and store documents, files, and information for easy retrieval.
		Use Technology Tools: Take advantage of productivity tools and technology solutions to streamline organization and prioritization tasks. Use task management apps, project management software, calendar apps, and collaboration tools to stay organized and efficient.
		Practice Time Blocking: Allocate dedicated time blocks for specific tasks, projects, or activities on your calendar. Reserve uninterrupted time for focused work and avoid multitasking to maintain productivity and concentration.
		Review and Adjust Priorities: Regularly review and reassess your priorities based on changing circumstances, deadlines, and goals. Adjust your to-do lists and task priorities as needed to stay aligned with your objectives and commitments.
		Maintain Work-Life Balance: Balance your personal and professional commitments to avoid burnout and maintain overall well-being. Allocate time for leisure, relaxation, and self-care activities to recharge and rejuvenate.

MATCHING AND MERGING DATA:
	Matching and merging data records involve identifying duplicate or related records from different sources and combining them into a single, comprehensive record. Here are some common techniques for matching and merging data records:
		Exact Matching: Compare data fields, such as names, IDs, or unique identifiers, between records to identify exact matches. Records with identical values in key fields are considered potential matches and can be merged into a single record.
		Fuzzy Matching: Use fuzzy matching algorithms to identify similar or approximate matches between records. Fuzzy matching techniques, such as Levenshtein distance, Jaccard similarity, or Soundex encoding, account for variations in spelling formatting, or abbreviations to identify potential matches.
		Blocking: Divide the dataset into smaller blocks or subsets based on predefined criteria, such as initial letters, zip codes, or date ranges. Compare records within each block to identify potential matches, reducing the computational complexity of the matching process.
		Tokenization: Break down data fields into tokens, such as words or phrases, and compare individual tokens between records. Token-based matching techniques allow for partial matches and variations in word order or punctuation.
		Record Linkage: Use probabilistic record linkage techniques to compare multiple data fields and calculate the likelihood or probability of two records referring to the same entity. Record linkage methods, such as probabilistic matching or machine learning algorithms, assign weights to different matching criteria and determine the overall similarity between records.
		Rule-Based Matching: Define custom matching rules or criteria based on domain knowledge or business requirements to identify potential matches. Rule-based matching techniques allow for flexible and customizable matching logic tailored to specific use cases or data characteristics.
		Human Review: Conduct manual review and validation of potential matches by subject matter experts or data stewards. Human review ensures accuracy and reliability in matching and merging records, especially for complex or ambiguous cases that cannot be resolved automatically
		Data Consolidation: Merge matched records into a single, consolidated record by combining relevant attributes and resolving conflicts or discrepancies. Data consolidation techniques involve selecting the most accurate or complete information from each source and creating a unified representation of the entity.
		Data Quality Assessment: Evaluate the quality and reliability of data sources and attributes before matching and merging records. Assess data completeness, accuracy, consistency, and timeliness to identify potential issues or errors that may affect the matching process.
		Audit Trail: Maintain an audit trail or record of matching and merging activities, including the rationale, decisions, and actions taken during the process. Audit trails provide transparency, accountability, and traceability for data integration and quality management efforts.
